Experiment 1: 
    - Verify wheel measurements: do one full rotation of the wheels and see if lidar reading is pi*d closer
Expmt 2:
    - Verify wheel separation. Check distance from right wall by rotating 90 on the spot, then do single wheel 180 deg rotation and check again by rotating -90 on the spot.
