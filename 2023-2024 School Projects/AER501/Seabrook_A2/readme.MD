To structure the input files correctly, add the following line to the bottom and run the mesh file. "save("Mesh{mesh #}.mat", "NOD", "X", "Y", "constr_node", "dof_active", "itmp");" 
Replace {Mesh #} with the mesh number of the file. If using the (.mat) input files I provided, this step can be skipped. 

To run the scripts in this assignment, run the file called maindriver.m. The function will read in the mesh files automatically.
