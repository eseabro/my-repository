Hello!
This is a game to answer the prompt "GPAs and college transcripts donâ€™t paint a complete picture of a person. What else do we need to know about you?"
This is a "Choose your own adventure" style game where you will get options and you will get to type in your choice. 
The game requires that python (any version) is installed. 
If this is not possible, view the .mp4 file that is included. If the game runs, the .mp4 file is not necessary.
